The folder mysite/ the name can be anything and is simply a container for the project.

The folder mysite/mysite/ is directory is the actual Python package for your project. Its name is the Python package name you’ll need to use to import anything inside it 

 This is the folder you will usually by inside of.

Django root directory is the directory that contains manage.py

What are apps in Django?
	An app is a Web application that does something – e.g., a Weblog system, 
	a database of public records or a small poll app. An app can be in multiple projects.

What are projects in Django?
	A project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular website.
  A project can contain multiple apps.
  
Create the db with this command: python manage.py migrate
	Creates your database accoriding to settings in the mysite/settings.py file and existing 
	db migrations shipped with django.
	
	
'python manage.py makemigrations polls' Tells Django youve made some changes to your models.
	and that you want your changes to be stored as a migration. This means you model infomation is
	saved into migrations files which can then be run using python manage.py migrate. This command actually
	makes changes to the database. This command only runs migrations that havent been run yet.
	
	
'python manage.py createsuperuser' Creates a new user that can access the Django admin console.

'python manage.py runserver' Start the DEV server. Uses a small lightweight server 
	built into Djanog, not for prod at all.
	
python manage.py shell
	Allows you to open an interactive python shell that can make changes to your site and db.

'https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html' Go here and install pymongo to use mongodb with Django.

Install Django:
	pip3 install Django

Install DJONGO
	'pip install djongo'
	
DOWNGRADE PYMONGO
	'python -m pip install pymongo==3.12.2'
	For some reason pymongo 4.0 doesnt work with djongo so downgrade it to this.
	Not sure why or how I was supposed to know that but someone on stackoverflow recommended to downgrade pymongo.
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70185942/why-i-am-getting-not-implemented-error-
	database-objects-do-not-implement-truth
	
	
Djongo allows us to use Django as if we had a relational database, so refer to this as a reference
	https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro/tutorial02/ when working with database data in django. The tutorial
	is using an interactive shell but it works the same in the actual Djanog view code.
	
	https://www.djongomapper.com/get-started/ -- shows you how to use Djangos built in relational object methods
	to interact with the mongodb database.

Create new Django App
	python manage.py startapp user_login_app

pip freeze | grep pymongo - view what version of pymongo is running on your project
pip freeze | grep djongo


Install Nginx   
	sudo apt install nginx
   
Remove enabled site that you dont need.
   rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
   

Allow NGINx through firewall by using UFW
	sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
	
Allow SSH to server DO THIS BEFORE STARTING UFW or else you cant connect back to the server
	sudo ufw allow ssh



MONGODB:
	
	connect to mongodb shell 'mongo'
	
	Show all databases 'show databases'


	Collections are like tables, collections hold documents, and each document has an id or object id which is 
	like a 	primary key.
	
	'use dbname' to use or create a db
	'db.dropDatabase()' to delete a db
	'db.createCollection('collectionName')' create a collection, which is like a table with the given name
	'db.collectionName.insert({key: 'value', date: Date(), likes: 4, tags: ['news', 'events'], user: {name: 'Johny', status: 'author', age: 99} })'
		insert a value into the collection, like inserting a row in sql.
	'show collections' shows all the collections in the db
	'db.collectionName.find().pretty()' - shows all documents in the collection. pretty is optional but makes it the output look nice.
	'db.posts.find({ category: 'News'}).pretty()' Finds the document in posts that has category equal to 'News'.

List information about running db server
	db.serverCmdLineOpts()
	127.0.0.1:60924
	db name: red_alert_db_development
	
Show ipaddress and port number for running db server	
	db.runCommand({whatsmyuri : 1})


Start Stop or Restart mongodb local server
	sudo systemctl status mongodb
	sudo systemctl stop mongodb
	sudo systemctl start mongodb
	sudo systemctl restart mongodb
